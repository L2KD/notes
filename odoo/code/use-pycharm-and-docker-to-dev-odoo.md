This is written for MacOS, on Linux, things should be the same.

First of all, create a directory in which your works will be located.

    mkdir ~/Projects/docker-odoo

Inside this, structure your directory like

    ~/Projects/docker-odoo
                  ├── addons/
                  ├── config
                  │     └── odoo
                  │          └── odoo.conf
                  ├── docker-compose.yml
                  └── odoo
