## DeadBeef

A (cloned?) foobar2k is available as `deadbeef` (AUR).

It may require `libdispatch` (AUR).

Out-of-the-box, everything should be working as expected, including using good quality external DACs.

## Deadbeef useful plugins

Most of the plugins are based on GTK2 AND GTK3.

For user installed plugins, put them into `~/.local/lib/deadbeef`. If the directory doesn't exist, create it.

To build plugin from source, clone the repo, then `make`, then run `userinstall.sh`.

1. deadbeef-plugin-musical-spectrum
2. ddb_misc_waveform
3. ddb_misc_filebrowser
4. Spectrogram.
5. VU meter.
6. GTK3 Header.
